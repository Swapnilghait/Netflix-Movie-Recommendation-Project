# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-Project


Absolutely! Here's a detailed overview of your Netflix movie recommendation project for the documentation in your GitHub README file:

**Overview**

The Netflix Movie Recommendation Project is a machine learning-based system designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their previous viewing history. Leveraging the power of the ECLET algorithm, this project aims to enhance the user experience on the Netflix platform by offering tailored movie suggestions.

**Features**

Personalized Recommendations: The system analyzes a user's past movie preferences and suggests new movies that align with their interests.
Large Dataset Handling: The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation model contains a total of 7466 rows and 20 columns, ensuring a diverse range of movie choices.

**Machine Learning Algorithm (ECLET):** 

The recommendation system is powered by the ECLET algorithm, which employs advanced techniques to understand user preferences and generate accurate recommendations.

**GitHub Repository:** 

The project's codebase is hosted on GitHub, providing transparency and enabling collaboration with other developers.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project comprises various movie attributes such as title, genre, and user ratings. It includes a wide range of movie genres, ensuring comprehensive coverage for recommendation generation.

**Project Structure**

The project consists of the following components:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the dataset to train the recommendation model effectively.
Model Training: Utilizing the ECLET algorithm to train the recommendation model on the preprocessed data.
Recommendation Generation: Implementing algorithms to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the recommendation system through metrics such as accuracy and user satisfaction.
